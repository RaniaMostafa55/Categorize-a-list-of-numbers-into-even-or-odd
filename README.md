Task2

A new Dart project.

## Getting Started

This project helps you know if your numbers are even or odd by these steps:
1. Create a list of integer numbers
2. Create a "for loop" to iterate in the list
3. Calculate the remainder by dividing each number by 2
4. Use "switch" to check the value of the remainder
5. if the value of the remainder is zero, it means that it's an even number
6. if the value of the remainder is not zero, it means that it's an odd number
